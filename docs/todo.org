Gameplay components

** Power: Political, Diplomatic, Civic, Military
   Power represents the abstract ability of the state in various regards. The capacity controls
   the 'width' of the state or rather the size of the bureacracy.

   Poltical power is the state's ability to enforce its policies and to which degree they are effective.
   By spending more poiltical power behind an effort the effects are controlled. 


 - Politcal power can be negative which increases the risk of harmful events such as ...
 ... generals disobeying order(s) 
 ... riots (decreases political capacity temporarly)
 ... plebian work strikes (decreases political capacity temporarly)
 ... murder of politicians (decreases political capacity permanantly)
 ... 

** Constructions
   - Increases power capacities
   - Enables new gameplay
     - Ex) Forums enable markets to be held. 

** Gold
   - Buys constructions
   - Earned by various taxes, constructions, (?) 

** Policies
   - Affects modifiers in game (tax income percentages, number of markets day in a month, etc)
     - Ex) Enact public toilet fees, 

** Food
   - Required in order to grow the population (?)
     - ? Why is food important?

** Events
   - Various desicions that affects the gamestate and provides flavor.
     - Ex) Abolish nexum [Y: ?, N: ?]

Feedback chains

 - Short
) 

 - Medium
) Unlocking new constructions enables progression
) Moderating the numbers through various means
 - What means? 
) 

 - Long
) Events change the gamescape, by changing the effectiviness of various game elements, thus ensuring 
that tweaks to the state is always neccessary and thereby providing opportunity for gameplay over 
the course of game's length.
 
 - Game length/over life time of game
Explicit goals unlike EU4 is to prevent the collapse of Rome thus making the game time infinite.
Historically the times will change very little (no modern inventations except contempory ancient ones).

Short-term goals?
- Ex #1) Click to implement a policy
Medium-term goals?
- Ex #1) By implementing the policy our revenue will grow ... 
         ... so that I can fund the war effort in the against Carthage
Long-term goals?
- Ex #1) Preventing the collapse of Rome (as a nation)?

** Progression
1. More power points = Able to do MORE (actions).
2. More gold = Build constructions 
- Unlocks new policies, constructions, etc.

** TODO Binary save to file of gamestate
** TODO Binary load from file of gamestate
** TODO JSON save to file of gamestate
** TODO JSON load from file of gamestate
** TODO Generate random consul names with the date string (get_year_str)  

** TODO Market days implementation
** TODO Roman school (increases income by having the students pay)
