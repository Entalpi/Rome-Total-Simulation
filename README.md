# Rome : Total Simulation
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Entalpi/Rome-Total-Simulation/master/resources/screenshots/rts-screenshot.png)

In Rome: Total Simulation your goal is to ensure that *voice of Palpatine* the
Republic (of Rome) survives the struggle between the patricians and plebians
known as the conflict of the orders. The game takes place from 350 BC to around
0 AD.

How you go about this is by balancing the needs of the aristocracy and the
masses by commissioning construction projects, enact laws that affect the life
of all Romans and last but not least wage war against non-Romans (and
occasionally put down a slave revolt or two).

The main ways to do all this is to ensure that the gold keeps flowing towards
Rome and that the food and water supply is safe.

This project was born out of a love of Roman history and the lack of deep and
fun historical simulators that did not skimp on the details.

It is written in C because one mans pain is another mans fun as the famous saying goes.
The user interface is either a actually working GUI version or the now
seriously-in-need-of-a-update terminal user inteface (TUI).

The core philosophy regarding the gameplay is that spending in-game resources
should feel impactful and that one should actually learn something regarding
Roman history simply by playing the game.
